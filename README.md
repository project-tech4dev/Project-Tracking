# Project-Tracking
Tracking Repo for Tech4Dev Projects. Projects are tracked using issues in this project. Status reports are added as comments to the project issue.

## Adding a Project
Go to the Issues tab and click on New Issue. Select the Tech4Dev-Project template to begin. The format for the title of the issue is **`<NGOName>-<SPName>`**

In the new project template, enter all the information requested. 

**Make sure you have everything correct before you submit the issue. You can't edit this information after the issue is submitted.** 

If you realize that you made a mistake after you submit your project, follow these steps.

1. On the Issues page, click on the title of the issue.
2. Click on the Edit button on the top right of the issue.
3. Change the title of the issue to `<title>-deleted`.
4. Close the issue.
5. Create a new issue with the original title with all the corrected information; you can copy information from the closed issue.

## Adding Status Updates and Comments
